excerpt: 'This paper presents the conclusions of our extensive benchmark of multimodal machine learning approaches to predict immunotherapy outcome in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This analysis was performed on an original cohort of metastatic NSCLC patients treated with first line immunotherapy, gathering data modalities such as Positron Emission Tomography scans, bulk RNA transcriptomic data from biopsy tissues, or pathological slides.'
