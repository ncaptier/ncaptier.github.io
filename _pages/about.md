I am a machine learning researcher interested in the development and translation of new computational methods to solve healthcare challenges.

I did my PhD at Institut Curie, in the [SysBio](https://institut-curie.org/team/barillot) and the [LITO](https://www.lito-web.fr/en/) laboratories, under the supervision of Emmanuel Barillot and Irène Buvat. I worked on multimodal machine learning approaches to predict immunotherapy outcome for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients ([link to my thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04708324)).

Before that, I graduated from [Ecole polytechnique](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program). I have a master's degree in applied mathematics from Ecole polytechnique, and a master's degree in mathematics, vision, and learning ([master MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)) from ENS Paris-Saclay.

I am currently looking for a postdoctoral position in machine learning applied to biomedical questions. Do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:nicolas.captier[at]curie.fr">reach out</a> !
